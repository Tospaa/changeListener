# changeListener

This script lets you play the game without worrying about backing up save files. Because it will backup the file for you.

Script will watch the file that you specified for changes, if the file has changed it will copy the file to a directory that you specified, with a generic name that you specified.

That simple.

Note: Script requires "psutil" module.
